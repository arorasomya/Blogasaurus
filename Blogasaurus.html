            Hi My name is Somya and I am from Edison, New Jersey.</br>
            When I'm bored, I like to ride my bike and go hiking (or even read sometimes - but that is kind of rare)</br>
            I LOVEEE food (vegetarian food:))</br>

              This coming Fall, I will be attending Princeton University and so I need to make sure I completely utilize this summer and make it fun filled! </br>
              I might be going camping to Acadia National Park.</br>
              And to cover the fun part, I have Google CSSI!!!</br>
